J2B Synthesizer
===============

An open source, open hardware music synthesizer for you to enjoy.
Based on an LPC1347 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller, this synthesizer
uses PWM to output sound. Originally based on and inspired by the Soulsby
Atmegatron.

Software is an LPCXpresso project.

Precompiled binaries are included for several synthesizers including
one drum machine. Uploading the firmware to the microcontroller is as simple 
as copying a file to a USB stick (this works on Windows only).

Licensed as described in the diverse licenses that may be found in the
repository. Roughly they state that you are allowed to do whatever you want
with this, as long as it remains for private use. However, you are allowed
to make money from music made with the J2B Synthesizer.
